https://devfolio.co/projects/smartswap-b15f,SmartSwap,"Why are you participating for Based India? We’re excited to be a part of Based India because we need smarter, safer tools for liquidity providers and traders alike. Which is why we created SmartSwap. By using Base's infrastructure, we are able to build highly innovative and intelligent Automated Market Maker (AMM) solution, SmartSwap empowers liquidity providers and traders both. This hackathon provides a great platform to contribute to the DeFi ecosystem in India and explore the technical advancements that Base enables for cross-chain solutions. What challenges are you focusing on? One of the biggest challenges in DeFi, is dealing with losses during periods of high market volatility. We are addressing the challenge of liquidity provider (LP) losses during periods of elevated volatility. Traditional AMMs are static in nature and do not adapt to fluctuating market conditions, often leading to significant losses for LPs due to arbitrage and impermanent loss. These issues are particularly acute in volatile markets, where LPs face Loss-Versus-Rebalancing (LVR) risk. This problem is not only common globally but also limits the appeal of DeFi in emerging markets like India, where users may need to be more aware of liquidity risks in decentralized exchanges. How does your submission address this challenge? SmartSwap introduces AI/ML-powered dynamic fee mechanisms that adjust trading fees in real-time based on market volatility. This reduces LP exposure to arbitrageurs and LVR, protecting their assets during volatile market conditions. Our solution leverages Base's infrastructure to facilitate cross-chain communications, enabling a broader scope for liquidity management across EVM-compatible chains. With on-chain AI/ML inference on Base, SmartSwap can respond intelligently to market changes, providing liquidity providers with better risk management tools and a safer trading environment.Through SmartSwap, we aim to make decentralized finance safer for all participants, encouraging more users to become liquidity providers and helping DeFi ecosystems thrive.

https://devfolio.co/projects/hygenie-making-hands-cleaner-one-step-at-a-time-fa67,"HyGenie: Making Hands Cleaner, One Step at a Time!","The problem HyGenie: Making Hands Cleaner, One Step at a Time! solves The spreading of germs and pathogens happens very quickly and without our knowledge. Youtuber Mark Rober showcased an experiment in which he showed how germs spread through contact through the use of Glo Germ Powder, which is visible under UV light.
The COVID-19 Pandemic especially emphasized the importance of keeping our hands clean, as the virus spread quickly through contact with contaminated surfaces. Maintaining proper hygiene habits is very important, especially in public areas like airports, stores, to ensure that you don't fall ill or spread germs to others who may come in contact with you.
The best way to keep our hands clean is by washing them properly. For this purpose, the World Health Organization (WHO) specified step-by-step guidelines to ensure that your hands are washed thoroughly. Additionally, we have noticed throughout restrooms in Georgia Tech's campus and other public restrooms that notices are put up reminding people to wash their hands for a specified amount of time.
Which brings us to the question: How many people actually know about these these guidelines, and how many people actually pay attention to and follow the recommendations on the notices put up on campus and other public restrooms? Mark Rober    Inspired by this problem statement, we aimed to create an application that could be used in public restrooms, that tracked the hand movements of people washing their hands and showed them through a display, how long they have to perform the current washing action, which action they have to perform next, and if the user stops performing one of the actions before reaching 100% of the action time, it will stop the countdown and ask them to finish performing the action for the specified time. This ensures that all the steps specified by WHO to wash your hands are followed. Challenges we ran into Data Collection and Feature Extraction Challenges: After a deep dive into hand gesture datasets and recognition models we found that there are no other datasets that can be used for our specific use case. Therefore, we had to collect our own data points, as well as identify which of the 426 features were important for our classification and detection tasks. Some features like finger positions, which we thought were important in the beginning, ended up causing our model to identify incorrect relationships. At the end of the day, we found that for the three gestures we were tracking, the palm coordinates and palm normals for each hand were the relevant features for gesture recognition.

People report it to etherscan or twitter, and it usually takes more than a week until the phishing account is deemed to be scam. By the time the account is known to be a phishing account, it is already too late and we have too many victims who already have lost their tokens. Solution We provide a anti scam RPC relayer which hooks to eth_sendRawTransaction, and inspects the destination address of the transaction.
We trained a binary classifier model using ethereum fraud detection dataset
The destination address is queried to the etherscan to get the latest transaction history, and they are used as input to the model we trained.

It is a heartbreaking reality that in this modern age, where medical advancements have reached unparalleled heights, countless mothers continue to face the devastating consequences due to inadequate maternal healthcare.
Mothers, the very embodiment of love, sacrifice, and nurturing, are the ones who give us life, shaping our world with their unwavering strength and unconditional affection. They are the pillars upon which families are built and societies thrive. Yet, tragically, mothers themselves are not safe. Maternal mortality is a grave injustice that must be addressed urgently, as it claims the lives of thousands of women worldwide.
Therefore, we introduce you to all our project Jivanam to curb this menace. We aim to reduce maternal mortality rates due to preventable causes through comprehensive healthcare, education, and empowerment.
Our vision is a world where every mother has access to quality healthcare throughout her pregnancy and childbirth journey, regardless of her social or economic status. We envision creating a platform that values and supports the well-being of mothers, providing them with the necessary resources, knowledge, and care to ensure safe and healthy pregnancies. We foster a global community that recognizes the fundamental right of every mother to bring new life into this world without compromising her own life.

https://devfolio.co/projects/diagnoseme-1992,DiagnoseMe,"The problem DiagnoseMe solves DiagnoseMe stands as an innovative desktop application harnessing the power of artificial intelligence, particularly large language models, to offer medical students a controlled environment for refining their diagnostic prowess. Beyond mere memorization of diseases and symptom diagnosis, the practice of medicine embodies empathy and a dedication to caring for others as one would their own family. This application facilitates realistic interactions with virtual patients, providing students with invaluable repeated practice essential for real-world patient encounters. In each scenario, DiagnoseMe crafts a distinct fictional patient afflicted with a specific ailment. These patients possess a predetermined list of symptoms derived from historical data, alongside a personality type commonly encountered in clinical settings. This immersive experience not only exposes students to diverse patient encounters but also fosters the development and refinement of their diagnostic skills. Challenges we ran into Gemini has been garnering attention in the news due to Google's impressive yet questionable demonstrations. Our initial attempt involved accessing the model through its API endpoints. While we managed to get the model up and running, along with our fully functioning app, we encountered an issue with Gemini not performing as desired. Regardless of the prompts and guidelines provided, it consistently veered off track, often hallucinating and forgetting prior information. In our case, where the application serves as a medical training device, such hallucinations pose significant risks. Providing doctors with false information could lead to misconceptions and faulty diagnoses. After numerous iterations, we opted to pivot and utilize OpenAI's GPT-3.5-Turbo instead, as it appeared to be the best alternative after conducting some research. Concerning our front-end development, we chose Electron as a framework due to its cross-platform functionality. However, we encountered several challenges when integrating React and its components into Electron's bundling systems. This necessitated multiple restarts of our app's packaging to ensure compatibility with the dependencies, following thorough examination of the documentation. Additionally, Electron is not inherently designed for multi-paginated apps like DiagnoseMe, necessitating adept webpack bundling and variable management. Our hurdles didn't end there. Another significant issue arose from the module setup of the frontend and the absence of local storage within Electron, rendering us unable to pass persistent data between React components. To address this, we devised a solution involving Python lists stored in the backend to maintain persistence, creating API endpoints to enable different components to query the data as needed.","JAVASCRIPT, FLASK, SCIKIT-LEARN, PANDAS, MATPLOTLIB, PYTHON, OPENAI, REACT.JS, RESTAPIS, ELECTRON JS","['like diagnoseme', 'virtual patients', 'diagnoseme', 'diagnostic prowess', 'scenario diagnoseme', 'diagnoses', 'diagnostic skills', 'patient encounters', 'diagnoseme necessitating', 'fictional patient', 'diagnoseme solves', 'patient afflicted', 'diagnoses numerous', 'patients', 'encountered clinical']",0.0

As the name suggests, it aims to be there for the people of a community, emphasizing collective economic empowerment and support to enhance community welfare. Our solution is based on pooling financial resources from all community members, including those reintegrating from prison, into a fund dedicated to supporting collective welfare projects. Our simulation over five years showcases how this model can be self-sustaining and significantly impact community development, particularly highlighting the successful reintegration of former prisoners as a use-case. The essence of Be4U is to demonstrate the power of community support in fostering an environment where everyone, regardless of their past, contributes to and benefits from a shared vision of prosperity and well-being. By focusing on the community chest as a tool for social and economic rehabilitation, the project provides valuable insights and enhances the quality of life for all community members. Designed as a resource for policymakers, community leaders, and rehabilitation initiatives, Be4U illustrates the feasibility of a community-centric approach to societal challenges. It champions the idea that a unified community can create a supportive ecosystem that not only aids in the reintegration of former prisoners but also bolsters the overall community's strength and resilience. Through Be4U, we envision multiple community chest based collective welfare as the cornerstone of growth and inclusivity. Challenges we ran into In developing Be4U, we encountered several challenges centered around data generation, feature engineering, and a deep understanding of our use case.

https://devfolio.co/projects/zero-knowledge-decision-tree-prediction-zkdtp-6b5f,Zero Knowledge Decision Tree Prediction (ZK-DTP),"The problem Zero Knowledge Decision Tree Prediction (ZK-DTP) solves Problem: In today's digital era, machine learning has become an essential tool for solving complex problems and making data-driven decisions. However, using ML models for sensitive applications can lead to privacy concerns and the potential for data leakage. This becomes especially challenging when the ML model provider needs to offer predictions without disclosing their proprietary model's critical attributes and thresholds. Traditional approaches for sharing ML models expose these sensitive details, making it difficult to strike a balance between functionality and privacy. Solution: Zero Knowledge Decision Tree Predict is designed to address this pressing issue by offering privacy-preserving predictions using decision tree models, built on top of RISC Zero's zkVM. ZK-DTP enables ML model providers to generate accurate predictions without revealing any sensitive information about the model or the input data. Use Cases: Healthcare: Safeguard patient privacy while enabling healthcare providers to make data-driven decisions based on ML models. ZK-DTP ensures that personal health information (PHI) and model details are kept confidential, improving patient trust and compliance with data protection regulations.
Finance: Enhance security and compliance for financial institutions by enabling them to utilize ML models for tasks like credit scoring, fraud detection, and portfolio management, without disclosing sensitive customer data or proprietary model information.

Our goal was to create an app which would eliminate the question ""...what next?"" when out with your friends or visiting a new city. Traverse simplifies the travel planning process by enabling users to quickly create itineraries for both their local area and other cities across the US. It addresses the common frustration of filtering through numerous options for decent restaurants and activities. Users can effortlessly generate itineraries filled with top-rated and affordable activities with just the push of a button, allowing them to spend less time planning and more time enjoying their trip or outing. The platform allows users to select a state and city, and after searching, it displays the top tourist attractions in a list and on an interactive map. Airbnb listings are also integrated, with the best Airbnbs for the price and quality being prioritized, appearing on the bottom left of the screen for easy accommodation planning. Furthermore, Traverse offers deep insights into Airbnb data, analyzing top hosts and neighborhoods with violin plots, running regression models with an 80/20 train-test split, predicting prices based on independent variables, and visualizing listings on a heatmap. This comprehensive approach turns the cumbersome task of travel planning into a streamlined and enjoyable experience, providing all necessary tools and data in one convenient platform. Challenges we ran into The primary hurdle we encountered in our project was sourcing datasets for points of interest in various cities, as they were either unavailable or prohibitively expensive. To overcome this, we utilized free credits from the Google API to develop a script that collects data on points of interest based on a given city in the US. Due to limited credits, we had to opt for a smaller radius in our searches, which was a significant compromise. Additionally, we aimed to provide users with visualizations of Airbnb listings to assist in their trip planning. Since no dedicated API was available for this purpose, we resorted to scraping these listings directly from the web. This process involved extensive data cleaning and analysis. We successfully created a robust visualization template that works with the listing data in CSV format. Moreover, we ventured into predictive analytics, using various listing variables to forecast the pricing of Airbnb listings, enhancing the user's decision-making process for their travel plans.

During the pandemic era, everyone is at courtesy of social help and this requires a large number of contributions from people. But doing this physically is not feasible. Working in CS requires being able to work efficiently in teams. But many students just slack off as they are unable to form/find a team. There’s also lack of social awareness towards nature and how important contributions are, may those be for social good or personal development for a student. With Alute, we aim at tackling both of these problems with a single solution.  Our solution
Alute - Learn and Contribute where users will easily be able to find projects and teams, or create a new one too. Creating and joining will be totally customized and easy. Using the credits they earn on our platform, they can be a part of social contributions as well get personal benefits. With a structured way to work and incentives provided to users to complete their projects, it is a win-win situation for all.

https://devfolio.co/projects/ethereal-4076,Ethereal,"The problem Ethereal solves We have created a blockchain network to be used by the banking system for their day to day transaction as well as the network itself is user friendly making it easy to use. the network also has a rewarding system for the miners (depending on the amount and quantity they'll be mining for) and an NFT mining chance But still the best advantage of using this system is, that there cannot be any kind of tempering with the transaction or data, hence for example if the bank is supposed to charge a minimum rate of interest from a specific company is 8% but due to external influence they charge around 6% while not showing the same changes in the balance sheet this is a typical case of forgery, this can always be avoided in our system, since the banks have a fixed minimum rate of interest that will be stored in our database with its exact hash value, so if the returned value does not matches with the existing hash value, it will trigger an alert in the system and will freeze the accounts used for the transaction while the blocks will be quarantined.
In the current baking system, there is a simple flaw that leads to banks lending more money that is already present in the circulation and/or is stored with them.(more explanation will be given if asked)
Since we will be incorporating the banking system and the block-chain network, for every money that will be invested upon buying the coins will be sent to banks, this will increase the amount of money banks are holding hence increasing their loan lending capabilities and will also generate interest for keeping the money in the bank(if 6% is given by the bank, 4% will be given to the investor, 1% to us, 1% to the bank)
Since the whole transaction occurs in the block chain network, there can not be any temperament or forgery in any way since it will trigger an alert and will quarantine the transaction details as well as the accounts.    Challenges we ran into They were many challenges that we encountered into the blockchain journey.
First was the time constraint, making and testing of such a huge project requires more than two nights to set up and do all the testing.
Setting up of the blockchain was one of the biggest challenges we faced. As we had to follow many norms in making the blockchain truly immutable. We had to carefully chose are tech stack to drastically cut down the time which was required to set up and debug the errors faced on the way.
As a team we had talented developers who worked very hard for the project and delivered more than original idea.
Because of the time constraints we were unable to show all the special feature of the network like the loan feature where customers can ask for a spontaneous loan which will be delivered instantaneously and help the user of our network to make important transactions. The role of a coin ledger which dynamically adjusts the value of the coin as compared to the fiat currency. We developed a custom ml method which dynamically allocate the transaction to miners with better compute power and thus reducing the load on the system. The gas fees are also dynamic and depends on the number of hashes that has been calculated. We have also created smart contract using solidity and deployed it on meta mask. We have pushed all the code on our GitHub repo for better understanding. We ran into many challenges but the organisers always helped us and were very supportive!

The way we approached the solution is by taking into consideration the aforesaid statistics. We mapped the data of wastage against “shortage”.

https://devfolio.co/projects/wellnex-eea9,WellNex,"The problem WellNex solves In today's rapidly evolving healthcare landscape, two primary challenges persist: the accuracy and speed of diagnosis, and the security and transparency of patient data. As the volume of patients grows, healthcare providers often find it challenging to offer timely and precise diagnostic services. Misdiagnoses or delayed diagnoses can lead to severe health complications, increased medical costs, and diminished patient trust. Moreover, with the digital transformation of healthcare, vast amounts of sensitive patient data are stored electronically. This data is susceptible to breaches, unauthorized access, and tampering. Patients are often left in the dark about who accesses their data, for what purpose, and whether their information remains intact. This lack of transparency and potential for data misuse has led to growing concerns about data privacy and security. By harnessing the power of Artificial Intelligence (AI), ""Wellnex"" offers rapid and accurate diagnostic insights. AI algorithms, trained on vast medical datasets, can analyze patient symptoms, medical history, and other relevant data to provide preliminary diagnoses. This not only speeds up the diagnostic process but also aids in the early detection of diseases, ensuring timely and appropriate medical intervention. The AI-driven approach reduces the burden on healthcare professionals, allowing them to focus on treatment and patient care. But ""Wellnex"" doesn't stop there. Recognizing the paramount importance of data security and transparency, the platform integrates blockchain technology. Every piece of patient data, every diagnosis, and every prescription is recorded on an immutable blockchain ledger. This ensures that patient data is tamper-proof and transparent. Patients can grant selective access to their health records, ensuring that only authorized personnel can view their information. ""Wellnex"" combines AI's diagnostic accuracy with blockchain's safety, for a trustworthy efficient healthcare future. Challenges we ran into We considered building a Flutter app to bridge the gap.

The score that Scout Global produces for each player aims to help NBA team scouts better understand who are the major players on the international stage and who may ultimately be a good fit for the NBA. It also allows the scouts to filter the players by position if they are looking to fill a particular position on their team. When an NBA team scout finds a player they like, they can click on the player and see what stats were used to calculate the player's score and other important information about the player. Empowers 1-100 player's position Scout Global filter the players by position Streamlines the scouting process by removing the necessity to search for hard-to-find stats about international players and the difficult process of finding the best players on the international stage. Instead, scouts can use Scout Global to easily find the top players and decide which players may be ready to head to the NBA draft.

However, it has become increasingly difficult to develop novel effective drugs, driving costs of research & development in healthcare up as time passes. In fact, the number of drugs produced per dollar spent has been decreasing exponentially, sometimes deemed Eroom's Law: the inverse of Moore's Law! The Application of Quantiative Investing Today, only around 5% of clinical trials reach Phase-4 approval for public use, making investing in them like betting $200 million on a home run--but you can only bet on one bat! As a result, funding for clinical trials has become a risky prospect for any potential investor, but what if we can utilize the power of quantitative investing to make these investments risk-averse? Challenges we ran into One challenge we ran into was acquiring a clean, sufficiently large dataset. Many datasets used by research papers in the same domain used private databases, so it was difficult to track down a dataset with features that were consistently documented. We utilized the ClinicalTrials.gov database to query clinical trials involving cancer–an arbitrary decision we made to acquire a reasonably sized dataset. The dataset provided by ClinicalTrials has many features to train, but some like Date/Time format were dirty and needed to be cleaned. Many fields were also qualitative, such as the descriptions of the trials, so we decided to generate new quantitative features with transformers to extract vector representations of sentences. We used the HuggingFace sentence_transformers API to apply trained models, but because of the large size of the dataset (approximately 100,000 rows x 30 columns), we submitted SLURM jobs on the Gatech PACE-ICE cluster to generate our cleaned dataset for training.

An estimated 2 to 5% of the world's GDP, or $800 billion to $2 trillion in current US dollars, is laundered internationally in a single year. It demands a more sophisticated monitoring system to keep an eye on transactions. Banks and other financial institutions can keep an eye on consumer transactions in real time or on a daily basis to identify potential risks by using “Fraud Busters”. The full process of identifying a possible case of money laundering will be automated by our system.
The software can give financial institutions a ""whole picture"" analysis of a customer's profile, risk levels, and expected future activity by combining these data with analysis of the customer's past information and account profile. It can also generate reports and create alerts to suspicious activity.  You can upload the Dummy Transaction Dataset and Predict to know the potential Money Laundering cases. With increasing crony capitalism and corruption due to the slightest of inefficiencies and people’s urges to make the most money in the shortest period of time, even not considering the legal implications, it is almost certain that we will see an increase in the amount of money being laundered in the global economy, without an interference by major players like financial institutions, consulting firms etc. These suspected fraudulent transaction can be predicted using the integration of a simple Artificial neural network and many future fraudulent activities can be prevented. In conclusion, the paragraph highlights the urgent need for effective measures to combat money laundering and financial crime in the face of increasing crony capitalism and corruption.

Most patients experience this when consulting telehealth services for the best treatments. That's because providers today see patients as a mixture of billing codes rather than people who have simple, yet complex, questions about their health. Intelliquette addresses them with its question-based (rather than product-based) UI, which connects the right combination of symptoms with conditions that best reflect a patient's health. These questions, as well as their corresponding responses, are produced by our bespoke AI-powered LangChain Large Language Model (LLM) syndicate, forming a distinct combination of technical acumen from a GPT-2-Medium model.

https://devfolio.co/projects/home-a-loan-9d6a,Home A Loan,"The problem Home A Loan solves The absence of a credit history can indicate different things, like being young or preferring cash transactions. Without traditional data, people with little to no credit history are likely to be denied loans. It is essential for finance providers to accurately assess who can repay a loan and who can't, making data crucial. By using data science to improve predictions of repayment capabilities, loans could be more accessible to those who could benefit the most from them. Currently, financial institutions use models called scorecards to predict loan risk. Since clients’ behavior changes constantly, every scorecard must be regularly updated, a time-consuming and tedious process. This often means loan providers struggle to identify potential issues until the first due dates of loans are visible. This is where Home A Loan steps in. Home A Loan is a data-driven model designed to assess the risk of default for clients. We started with a dataset consisting of 1.5 million data points, encompassing 220 features detailing historic loan outcomes. From this dataset, we employed LightGBM, a powerful machine-learning model, to extract six of the most influential features. This process allowed us to focus our analysis on the most critical factors driving loan outcomes. To ensure our models’ predictive power, we developed three distinct models: LightGBM, XGBoost, and logistic regression. Both LightGBM and XGBoost (0.739 5-Fold Stratified Validation AoC) are robust decision tree models renowned for their accuracy, while logistic regression (0.691 AoC) provides a baseline for comparison. With these models, we can assess the likelihood of a person defaulting on their loan, enabling informed decision-making in seconds. We envision financial institutions leveraging our models to broaden their acceptance of loan applications, potentially transforming the lives of individuals historically denied due to limited credit history. Our approach ensures deserving clients aren't overlooked. Challenges we ran into Throughout our project, we encountered several challenges that required innovative solutions: Identifying significant features that also add value (feature selection): We grappled with the task of pinpointing features that were not only intriguing but also influential in our model's predictive accuracy. To solve this issue, we implemented a large-scale LightGBM model that analyzed 220 features over 1.5 million data points and extracted 6 of the most influential features.

https://devfolio.co/projects/flick-0945,FLICK,"The problem FLICK solves The multi-lingual sign language interpretation platform is designed to make communication easier and more accessible for the deaf and hard-of-hearing community. It enables real-time conversations, allowing users to smoothly interact with hearing individuals in everyday situations. Educational institutions can integrate the platform into classrooms to provide instant sign language translations during lectures, fostering a more inclusive learning environment. In healthcare settings, the platform ensures that communication between medical staff and deaf patients is accurate and safe, reducing the potential for misunderstandings. For companies, it enhances remote work experiences by providing sign language support during virtual meetings, allowing deaf employees to fully participate. The platform’s mobile app ensures on-the-go accessibility, making everyday interactions—from grocery shopping to parent-teacher meetings—more manageable. With its community-driven updates, it stays current with new signs and regional variations, offering precise translations. Additionally, it can play a crucial role during emergencies, enabling first responders to communicate quickly with deaf individuals and potentially saving lives. This makes it a valuable tool across various contexts, improving inclusivity, safety, and ease of communication. Challenges I ran into The problem of not having a database for ISL(Indian Sign Language) is something that troubled us alot. Unable to find a dataset we trained our very own dataset it was a very tedious and time consuming task. Also we posed for different hands, different people did it under different lighting conditions and also with different backgrounds. All this work has been put in to increase the accuracy of the model, increasing the number of samples per sign has enabled us to increase the confidence score for prediction from 0.45 to 0.85. This shows our conviction in the model and the dataset. Also to increase the accuracy of the model modules like GausianFlow were integrated that inhanced our already existing model by isolating the sign and bluring the background. As keras libraries also get updated from time to time getting familiar with the new concept was also a task, but me and my team managed to plan and execute the model upto to our best potential","TENSORFLOW, KERAS, SCIKIT-LEARN, NUMPY, OPENCV, GOOGLE COLAB, PYTHON, JUPYTER NOTEBOOK, MEDIAPIPE, SKLEARN","['sign language', 'accessible deaf', 'language support', 'staff deaf', 'database isl', 'allowing deaf', 'deaf employees', 'ease communication', 'deaf patients', 'providing sign', 'mobile app', 'accessibility making', 'interact hearing', 'accessibility', 'deaf individuals']",0.0

How, if you type ""Sushi Restaurant"" in the Google Search bar, it only shows the restaurant near your area, and not on some remote Island of Japan? well, here's your answer. Your every search on the website creates your digital footprint, what you like, what you are looking from. This data is then fed in what is called a ""Recommender System"". Almost every website now uses recommender system to sort the search results according to thier user. this helps the retail stores as well as the costumers, as costumers dont have to go through the entire website to search SINGLE product( frustrating, right?), and websites gain as a happy costumer equals happy( and wealthy) website owner.
